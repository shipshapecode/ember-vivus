# Ember-Vivus

Installs `Vivus` and exposes it to your project. It will import the minified version for production builds only, and won't import anything if your app is running in FastBoot.

This methods used to import everything are based almost entirely on [ember-tweenlite](https://github.com/runspired/ember-tweenlite)

## Installation

`ember install ember-vivus`

## Usage

`import Vivus from 'vivus';`

To use, you just need to import Vivus in whatever file you'd like to use it in.
